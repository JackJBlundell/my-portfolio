      "description_long": "RouteBuddies is a safety-focused mobile and wearable ecosystem designed to give users a trusted way to buddy up, stay aware, and navigate their environments securely. Originally started as a personal learning project in 2020, the platform has grown into a full suite of applications including a consumer app, an Apple Watch companion app, a web-based admin panel, and enterprise/education-specific versions with custom UI themes and permission models.\n\nThe platform helps users connect with verified local communities, plan and track activities, view crime data from the UK Police API, share live locations, use automated and manual SOS functions, and receive personalised safety reminders. Community-specific modes such as Festival Mode, Education Mode, and Enterprise Mode provide private, branded spaces for organisations to run their own instance of the RouteBuddies experience. Automated content moderation ensures user-uploaded images remain safe and appropriate across the entire network.",
